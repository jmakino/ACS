The Art of Computational Science series will provide a student with a hands-on guide to
building a computational laboratory, and doing state-of-the-art
research with it. The series will be self-contained: a high-school
student should be able to start at page 1, and work her way through
the series.  <a href=manifesto.html> [more . . .]</a>
<p>
Our aim is to break down the barrier between research and education.
From an educational point of view, our approach is unusual in that we
lead a student along the shortest path from an elementary introduction
to the cutting edge of research.  And from a research point of view,
we illustrate how extensive documentation is beneficial for a research
project.
<a href=extreme_research.html> [more . . .]</a>
<p>
We have coined the term <i> Variational Programming</i> to describe our
prefered approach to programming: to follow a path of least action.
The name is borrow from physics, where Hamilton's variational
principle states that a physical trajectory of a particle is given by
a path along which the action is minimal.
<a href=variational_programming.html> [more . . .]</a> 
<p>
Our book series explores a new approach to both research and
education in computational science, bringing out simultaneously
the science, arts and crafts aspects of research in the form of
an the educational offering.  
The whole series, together with the corresponding software, will
be presented on the web as an open source project.

Our plan is to generate ten volumes, hopefully by 2015 or thereabouts.
Our first product, below, is a draft version of what will expand into
the first three volumes of our series.  Given its short size, less
than 300 pages, it is not yet self-contained.  However, it offers a
student the ability to get started, with relatively little need to
consult other sources.
<p>
It is available in three versions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
As a web presentation, in <a href=vol_1/v1_web/v1_web.html>HTML format</a>
(<a href=vol_1/v1_web.html.tgz>tar archive for HTML</a>),
</li>
<p>
<li>
As a <a href=vol_1/v1_web.pdf>PDF file</a>,
</li>
<p>
<li>
As a postscript file, <a href=vol_1/v1_web.ps.gz>PS(gzipped)</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The original version was written in LaTeX, and therefore the (almost
automatic) translation to HTML pages, while acceptable, is not as
pretty as the pdf and ps files.
<p>
Here are the program examples given in our book:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The source codes are available as a <a href=vol_1/acscodes.tar>tar file</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here are some additional codes, provided by readers of <i>Moving Stars
Around</i>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
A <a href=contribs/Dehnen-nbody.tgz>faster version</a> of the variable time step Hermite scheme
in chapter 8, provided by <a href="mailto:wd11@astro.le.ac.uk">Walter Dehnen</a>.
<li>
A <a href=contribs/nbody_sh1p.tar.gz>parallel version</a> of the variable time step Hermite scheme
in chapter 8, provided by <a href="http://staff.science.uva.nl/~spz/">Simon
Portegies Zwart</a> and

For some codes, <a href=contribs/rubycodes.tgz>Ruby versions</a>
have been provided by Alfred Whitehead.
