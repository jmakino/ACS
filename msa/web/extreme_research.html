<H1> Extreme Research</H1>

&#169;  2003- Piet Hut and Jun Makino

<p>
The central aim of our book series is to break down the barrier
between research and education.  From an educational point of view,
our approach is unusual in that we aim to lead a student along the
shortest path from an elementary introduction to the cutting edge of
research.  At the same time, the reverse is true as well: from a
research point of view, we want to illustrate how extensive
documentation is beneficial for a research project.  To put it in a
more radical form: we believe that education is the key to success in
research.
<p>
To express these ideas, we introduce the term {\it extreme research},
in analogy of the term {\it extreme programming}, a methodology aimed
at frequent testing and fast turn-around, in which there is much
interaction between users and producers of the code being developed.
Typically there is a tight coupling between the producers as well,
through pair programming, in which two people sit behind a computer
screen, developing a piece of code together.  In our case, extreme
research indicates a similar type of interaction between students
developing a simulation code, and between them and their supervisors
and colleagues.
<p>
A key idea in our notion of extreme research is what we call {\it
variational programming}, which we will discuss below.  Briefly,
variational programming invites a `slower but faster' approach, in
which we first take our time, feeling our way around a solution path,
before settling on a specific approach.  The familiarity with the
local landscape of possible approaches typically speeds up the process
of reaching a simple yet robust final product.  Experience has shown
us that the time lost in looking around is more than made up by the
fact that we thus avoid having to backtrack excessively in the final
stages.
<p>
A related example of a `slower but faster' approach is to make it a
habit of writing extensive documentation.  This applies to adding
detailed and frequent comments with the computer code itself, as well
as writing manual pages and introductory and explenatory notes.  At
first, this may seem to slow down the process of rapid prototyping.
In fact, by having to explain what you are doing to an anonymous
reader, you often reach a much deeper understanding of the problem at
hand, by being forced to make your reasoning explicit.  In addition,
you often find errors in your thinking as well as ways to improve
aspects, even if they were correct.
<p>
Actually, wide and deep documentation goes hand in hand with variational
programming.  A description of anything is like drawing an outline around
that thing, and the very process of doing so gives one many glimpses
of the adjacent terrain.  Successful documentation of a code is a form
of variational description.  And in our current series we have taken
this approach to an extreme: one of our main motivations for writing
an education ten-volume series was our desire to develop for ourselves
a robust software environment for large-scale experiments in stellar
dynamics, relying on a process of extreme documentation.
<p>
The central engine of this environment would be an <i>N</i>-body code
that would be completely documented, down to every decision made.
This implies a description of not only what decision was made, made
also how it was made, and why.  When we thought this true, we realized
that we had no choice but to start from scratch.  Tempting as it had
been to take a code such as the Kira code, the central engine of the
<a href="http://www.manybody.org/manybody/starlab.html">starlab
software environment</a>, it would be
impossible to reconstruct all the decisions that had gone into its ten
year history.  The same considerations hold even more for NBODY4 and
related codes in the NBODY<i>x</i> family, developed and maintained by
Sverre Aarseth, author of <i>Gravitational N-Body Simulations :
Tools and Algorithms</i> (Cambridge Univ. Pr., 2003), since these codes
have grown over a forty-year period.
<p>
We finally decided to accept the challenge we had posed for ourselves,
and to test our notion of extreme programming in practice, by indeed
starting from scratch.
Here is a very brief outline of our plans.  The top view of our code
would reveal four parts: a scheduler, a module for the global
dynamics, one for the local dynamics, and one for stellar physics
(stellar evolution and hydrodynamics).  Each of the latter three would
be built from several modules.  At that level, we would thus have a
dozen or more modules, each of which would ideally be so independent
that they could be written by different people using different
computer languages.  Most importantly, these different people would
have no need even to communicate with each other, since the top-down
specification would indeed be completely specific about how each
module would talk to each other module, and what would be expected to
be delivered by each one, in what way.
