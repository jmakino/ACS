<h3>ACS 1.0</h3>

Our first ACS version, ACS 1.0, was released on June 2, 2004.
<p>
It contains the versions, at that time, of the first four volumes of
the Kali project, together with the first volume of the Open Knowledge
umbrella project.  In addition, the older volume <i>Moving Stars
Around</i>, is included.  In total, this release contains the
equivalent of roughly 700 pages of printed text,
together with the computer codes developed in the text.
<p>
We are making all releases presented here available under the
conditions of our <a href="mit.html">ACS open source license</a>.
<p>
We present ACS 1.0 in two option, each as a single tar file:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="acs-1.0.tgz">acs-1.0.tgz</a> (roughly 100 Mbyte), containing
<ul>
<li>
all html files present on the ACS web site at the time this version
was released
</li>
<li>
postscript and pdf versions of the text files
</li>
<li>
all computer codes discussed in the text
</li>
<li>
additional codes that are used for generating the .html, .ps, and .pdf
files from the original .ok files
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>
<a href="acs-lite-1.0.tgz">acs-lite-1.0.tgz</a> (roughly 30 Mbyte), containing
<ul>
<li>
a few top-level html files
</li>
<li>
all computer codes discussed in the text
</li>
<li>
the .ok files and codes that allow automatic construction of the .html,
.ps, and .pdf files, with the exception of those connected with the
MSA volume.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Note that you need to have a Ruby interpreter, in order to run the
computer codes that are provided.  If you don't have Ruby already
installed on your computer, you can pick up the latest version from
the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby Home Page</a>.
