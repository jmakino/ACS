<h3>2007, August 20-31</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We will hold a two week long N-Body Schoolin Split, Croatia,
for 60 students, with 6 teachers.  The arrival date will be August 19,
2007, and the departure date September 1, 2007.  Further details to be
provided in 2006.
</ul>

<h3>2005, November 21</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs122">ACS 1.2.2</a> is released.
ACS 1.2.2 presents a new lay-out of the ACS home page,
which reflects our latest thoughts about the structure
and evolution of our ongoing projects of development of
simulation code and documentation.
<li>
The <a href="../kali/index.html">Maya Project</a> is the new name for
what we used to call the Kali project.  <i>Maya</i> is now the name
for the software environment within which we will run the <i>Kali code</i>,
which will be our flagship integrator for simulating dense stellar systems.
While <i>Maya</i> will denote our virtual laboratory, <i>Kali</i> will
be our main laboratory tool.
<li>
We have started to rewrite our very first volume,
<a href="../msa/web/vol_1/v1_web/v1_web.html">Moving Stars Around</a>,
to bring it in line with the Maya project.  Specifically, we will use
a much more flexible plotting package, we will introduce a visualization
tool, and all codes will be written in Ruby.
<li>
We have a<a href="../kali/revised-five-year-plan.html">revised
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, again a large number of small corrections have been made.
<li>
For instructions to install the computer codes on your own computer, see this
<a href=README.html>README page</a>.
</ul>

<h3>2005, July 24</h3>

<ul>
<li>
We have held a week-long
<a href="http://modesta.science.uva.nl/modest/modest5c/index.html">N-Body
School</a> in Amsterdam, Holland, July 24-30, 2005.
</ul>

<h3>2005, July 12</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs121">ACS 1.2.1</a> is released.
ACS 1.2.1 presents the first part of what will be a new volume,
<a href="../kali/vol/multiple_runs/doc/files/_/_title_ok.html">16. 
N-Body Experiments: Orchestrating and Analyzing Multiple Runs</a>
<li>
We have drawn up our <a href="../kali/first-five-year-plan.html">first
five-year plan</a> for the Kali code development.
<li>
In addition, a large number of small corrections have been made.

<h3>2005, April 13</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="index.html#acs12">ACS 1.2</a> is released.
A novel feature of ACS 1.2 is the presentation of an N-body code that
allows individual particles to use not only individual time steps, but
also individual integration algorithms, from a wide range of choices
including <a href="acs-2.1-README.html">... (more)</a>
