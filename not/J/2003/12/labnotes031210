Hi Piet,

I made a simple benchmark of NArray. The code is the following

-------------------------------------
require 'narray'

print "\n With Ruby NArray\n"

nmax=1000000
m=10
while m<nmax*10
  n = nmax/m*10
  print "N,M = #{n}, #{m} "
  a = NArray.float(n)
  b = NArray.float(n)
  for i in 0...n
    a[i]=i 
  end
  tstart =  Time.times.utime
  for j  in 0..m
  b = a+a
  end
  print "Time=  ", Time.times.utime-tstart, "\n"
  m*= 10
end

print "\n With Ruby array\n"

m=10
while m<nmax*10
  n = nmax/m*10
  print "N,M = #{n}, #{m} "
  a=[]
  for i in 0...n
    a[i]=i 
  end
  tstart =  Time.times.utime
  for j  in 0..m
    b = a.collect{ |x| x+x}
  end
  print "Time=  ", Time.times.utime-tstart, "\n"
  m*= 10
end

-------------------------------------
It just performs element-wize add on array a, varying its length.
The result is:

<yebisu:/home/makino/src/test>ruby test1.rb

 With Ruby NArray
N,M = 1000000, 10 Time=  0.2
N,M = 100000, 100 Time=  0.15
N,M = 10000, 1000 Time=  0.17
N,M = 1000, 10000 Time=  0.23
N,M = 100, 100000 Time=  0.69
N,M = 10, 1000000 Time=  5.3

 With Ruby array
N,M = 1000000, 10 Time=  20.15
N,M = 100000, 100 Time=  18.29
N,M = 10000, 1000 Time=  18.09
N,M = 1000, 10000 Time=  18.07
N,M = 100, 100000 Time=  18.29
N,M = 10, 1000000 Time=  20.63

Thus, for long array (size>1000), the speedup is about a factor of
100. In other words, the speed for Ruby with NArray is essentially the
same as that with C/C++. In fact, the achieved speed is 50 Mflops,
which is quite good for a 600MHz cpu.

However, as you shorten the array size the performance degrade, and
with size=10 NArray is only 4 time faster. So we can guess that for
NDIM=3 NArray would not be faster at all.

Hmm, well, in principle we could do a bit better by designing and
implementing a very specialized routine for 1D array of a fixed
length, but even so the overhead of implementing any operation as a
Ruby function would be significant.

So I guess we need something either lower level or higher level.

To go to lower level. we can write a function which calculate, for
example, pairwize force calculation itself in C, or going 1-step
higher and write a function which takes an array of particles and
target particle to calculate the force from the array of particles to
the target particle.

In the higher level, we should design a "compiler", which generate
such a C function and necessary interface to Ruby from some Ruby-like
description...

Well, I guess we first need to experiment with the low-level approach.

Any idea?
