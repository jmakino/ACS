Okay, could you add that?

Either way.

You mean sample.gif by this? It was intentionally left out. Should I
make up something?

Well, I must say you can do as well...

Now acsdoc.rb automatically creates these files, and sample directives
are in that file itself. So you can try things immedietly. Please try
ruby acsdoc.rb README.cp acsdoc.rb at ACSROOT/src/co*ng and check the
result.
