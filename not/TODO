= TODO for acs

Time-stamp: <2004-01-20 11:32:01 piet>

* in ch2.cp, in:

  <tt>:inccode: .leap.rb+write</tt>

  acsdoc picks up <tt>nbody.write</tt> instead of <tt>body.write</tt>

  Perhaps we can implement <tt>.leap.rb+body.write</tt> ?

  That way, having +def+ and +end+ in the same column may no longer be
  necessary (though still a good idea!)

  Of course, we can make this arbitrarily complicated, but perhaps it
  would be worth while to allow something like <tt>.leap.rb+body</tt>
  for including the whole class definition of <tt>body</tt>, although
  we then probably would have to add some form of numbering, given that
  there are various additions, all called <tt>body</tt> class in the
  file <tt>leap.rb</tt>; perhaps <tt>.leap.rb+body+3</tt> ?  Hmmmm....

* how about replacing

  <tt>segment start: <i>name</i></tt>

  by 

  <tt>segment: <i>name</i></tt>

  ?

* in my current <tt>leap_attr_explanation.rb</tt>, I am using the
  +segment+ mechanism on an almost line by line basis.  Would it be
  better to just type those lines in the text of the book, or should
  we keep it here in this separate file?

* what about <tt>sample_init.rb</tt> ?  Leave out opening specific files?

* what about empty lines at the very end of our current <tt>ch3.rb</tt>,
  as the outcome of +diff+ and the previous few lines?  Are we happy
  with that?  It may be a bit confusing for the reader, to see three
  commands listed without any output.

* how to run acsdoc; for only one chapter at a time?

* a cleanup mechanism for all the <tt>.something</tt> files?

* we haven't yet succeeded in including figures in our old lab notes;
  the following, at the end of section 3.3 in <tt>labnotes031112</tt>
  did not work (I'm using LINK instead of link, to get the output here):

  <tt>LINK:../P/2003/11/images/labnote-031112.gif</tt>

* in this same file, in <tt>5. Generation of Lab Notes</tt>
  mysteriously the number 5 becomes 1 !?!

* we should implement Ato's errata in our first book:

 Dear Piet and Jun,
  I have started reading "The Art of Computational Science". I do not know
  if the version on the web is the latest and if you are interested in
  hearing bug reports, but I thought I would let you know of some typos
  I noticed in the book. 
  
  7.2 A Standard $N$-Body Snapshot Format
   
  after the paragraph that starts with "For example, to store the initial..."
  the given example has one line too many.
   
  - - -
   
  after the paragraph that starts with "As soon as our program starts..."
  the array indices are all 0, they should be 0, 1, and 2
   
  - - -
   
  11.4 Dynamically Produced Binaries
   
 in Alice, starting with "You may not have heard of it...", says "Monte Carol",
  should be "Monte Carlo", spoils the joke that comes afterward :-)
  
  I hope you find this useful,
  
  cheers,
  
  ato

* in our book, we may want to say a few more words about the notion of
  the `order' of a differential equation?  This was the main point of
  criticism that Bob Vanderbei mentioned.

* in our labnotes and elsewhere, how/when shall we implement reference
  pointers?

* what shall we do with a table of contents, for our book in rdoc?

* are <tt>!name!</tt> and <something> useful, as mentioned
  in <tt>rdoc-0.9.0acs1/README.local</tt> ?
