intro: |
  We present here a code management system for Ruby, based on libraries
  that maintain different file versions in parallel, and that can provide
  the right version for each file, dependent on directives given in programs
  that include that file.  Full information about the code management system
  can be found in:

  description: |
    The code management system is based on libraries that maintain
    different file versions in parallel.  When a program includes a file
    by a given name, the correct version of that file will be retrieved
    from the library, based on the file date range specified in the program.
